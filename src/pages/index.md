All of the artwork in this display are drawings using common children’s school supplies.  Each picture was done using one of the following mediums;

* #2 School pencil
* Colored pencils
* Crayon

I have worked with nearly every medium over the years but I prefer pencil.  I think it’s probably the detail I can get with pencil that I can’t get with any other medium.  I have never had a formal art lesson in my life but the years of practice have proved to be an education in itself.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I have enjoyed making them.
