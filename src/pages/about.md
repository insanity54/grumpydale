I am happily married with 2 children, 5 step children and 16 grandchildren. Much to my delight, all of our grand-children have learned to call me "Grandpa Dale" which always brings a smile.

Several years ago our 13 year-old daughter thought it was funny to go around and teach the little grandchildren to say "Grumpy Dale." Everyone thought it was cute, so we chose to use the name for our business. I'm really not grumpy, but is sure is a lot of fun.

I worked in the electronics industry all of my adult life but my real interest has always been for the love of art. I never received a formal education in the field of art, but the years of practice have provided an education in its self. I have experience with oils, acrilics, water colors, pastels and chalk, but my favorite has always been pencil drawings. All of the artwork that you see here was done with either black pencil or colored pencil.

For many years I have given hand made greeting cards to family and friends, and now I am making some of those greeting cards available to the public. With encouragment from my wife, children and grandchildren, I have been persuaded to share some of my fun drawings with you. I hope that you enjoy receiving them as much as I have enjoued making them.

Thank you,
A. Dale DuRee
