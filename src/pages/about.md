I came to North Idaho in 1989 to visit and never left again.  I have lived here long enough now that I consider myself to be a native.  North Idaho has become my home and I love to be here.  My children grew up here but they are all gone now to live their own lives.  Much to my delight, all of the grand-children have learned to call me "Grandpa Dale" which always brings a smile.

A number of years ago my daughter thought it was funny to go around and teach all the little ones to say "Grumpy Dale." Everyone thought it was cute, so we chose to use the name for our business. I'm really not grumpy, but is sure is a lot of fun.

I worked in the electronics industry all of my adult life but my real interest has always been for the love of art.  I have never had an art lesson in my life, but the years of practice have provided an education in its self.

I have experience with oils, acrylics, water colors, pastels and chalk, but my favorite has always been pencil.   Now crayon has been added to my collection and is quickly becoming my newest favorite.

For many years I have given hand-made greeting cards to family and friends, and now I would like to share them with you.  I hope you enjoy receiving them as much as I have enjoyed making them.


Thank you,

A. Dale DuRee
